I've been told English is going to be the new way we write code. I figured since I know Python already, I should at least make an attempt to learn this new programming language called English. It's a bit verbose and hard to read but what better way to learn than write a blog?

Is what Gemini tells me. Unfortunately, for you, there'll be none of that here; my technical explanations will be practically *dripping in mediocrity*.

Instead you will get a Python engineer's view into different technical fields of which he knows very little about. If you're lucky you might experience a fleeting moment of amusement, certainly not enough for a chuckle. There won't be LLM proofreading, or likely any proofreading for that matter, I don't even have spellchecker turned on in my VSCode markdown. Bad prose is a rarity and typeos a scarcity in this LLM market.

With the preamble out of the way... what might you find here? I'm a **Python data engineer** by day (and a crime fighting vigilante by night) here to spend 2026 learning about new things in technology.

I initially wanted to find a new thing to learn for every month of 2026 but realised that would be too much effort. Instead I've settled on a new thing every quarter, four things for the year. It's not a lot of time per topic; if you've ever heard of the **Pareto principle** it says that 80% of the consequences (knowledge) is made up of 20% of the causes (learning).

That's a bit too ambitious for me, and doing some naive scaling of the above tells me that **3% of the learning might yield ~20% of the knowledge for me**. That's certainly enough for me! And it might just land me short of the stage of the Dunning Kruger curve where I stumble on the self realisation that I don't know anything at all about that topic to publish a blog post at all.

## So what's on the roadmap?

Well... that's a lot of forward thinking, but I need at least some semblance of a new years resolution for 2026. So I'll leave you with the below:

1. Embedded programming with **C++** (this is certainly going to be the metaphorical deep end)
2. **DevOps** and cloudy computing
3. **Svelte** and making a page in the browser look vaguely appealing
4. Either **assembly** xor cryptography

I don't know how to write conclusions. Bye.
